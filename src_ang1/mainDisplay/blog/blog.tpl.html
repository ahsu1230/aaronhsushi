        If you've ever seen a documentary about sushi, you get to see the detailed and extensive training it takes to become a master sushi chef. From cooking rice, to roasting seaweed to cutting fish, it feels daunting just to see how much there is to learn and to perfect.

        It's easy to get caught up in all the technicalities. But, from my journey, I've come to realize that at the end of the day, sushi, at its very core, is just something to eat - it's really just food. And whether you're eating it or making it, food is always best shared with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I journey through my sushi expedition, of course I want to learn all the technicalities that go into becoming a master chef. However, I also don't want to forget what is truly important: the simple joy of sitting down with friends and families and seeing smiles all around the table. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sushi, to me, is not just an artistic discipline. It's also a hobby that I hope to share with as many people as possible and to provide memorable bonding experiences between strangers, light acquaintances and bffs. 
      </p>
      <p>This is my ultimate sushi goal. <b>This is what it means to enjoy Hsushi.</b> =)

      <div class="blog-post-title">Lab Experiment: Flower Decor</div>
      <div class="blog-post-subtitle">June 28th, 2015</div>
      <img src="../img/blogImg/pad-see-ew-thai-noodles.jpg" class="blog-image blog-image-center">
      <p>
        The thought of using flower decor came when I was eating a Thai rice-noodle dish, Pad-See-Ew, with a purple lei orchid on the side. Somehow, the flower just gave the entire dish an exotic, vibrant look - even though we were in a very white American suburban area (Rockville, MD represent!). It wasn't until when I started making sushi, did I really appreciate the importance of color contrast in plating.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/blogImg/blossom_zoomin.jpg" class="blog-image blog-image-left" width="40%">
      <p>
        Sushi usually comes in a few colors: salmon orange, deep tuna red, yellow-ish avocado green and silvery-white from white fish. To complete the full color spectrum and to get a vibrant contrast, you would want some blue or purple.
      </p>
      <p>
         Unfortunately, sashimi doesn't come in those colors, so a bright flower sitting to the side provides a great contrasting accessory without taking away from the main picture. Where would you get them? I happened to find purple orchids on sale at Safeway and even went out to my backyard to pluck a few blossoms off one of the trees (the latter I do not recommend putting in your food, but oh well).
      </p>
      <img src="../img/blogImg/blossom_all.jpg" class="blog-image blog-image-center">
      <p>
        This time, I probably went overboard with the blossoms - Gordon Ramsay once said on Master Chef that decor should be edible and they should be positioned with purpose. But I was experimenting with where I could place them and what I could do with them. Can flowers go into the roll? What about next to the roll? Why not under something? I really wanted to stretch my mental frame and think outside the box. 
      </p>
      <p>But really the main reason, why I put flowers everywhere, is... because the flowers come in a huge bundle and I already paid for it - I needed to use as much as possible and get the most out of my buck, soo.. yolo! Chef Ramsay can't handle my swag! Jk, I'd love to be yelled by him on Hell's Kitchen one day. It's a life goal.

      <div class="blog-post-title">Local Pick: Sushi Tomi, Mountain View</div>
      <div class="blog-post-subtitle">June 24th, 2015</div>

        Coming from the east coast, and landing in Mountain View, CA, everybody was raving about the best sushi in the suburban downtown area: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-tomi-mountain-view">Sushi Tomi</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Off to the side from the busy (I guess it would be "South Bay" busy) downtown Castro St, lays a small restaurant that seems to always have groups of people just chilling outside. The fish here is fresh, the portions are generous, and the menu contains many crowd-pleasing selections. The chirashi bowls are beautifully assembled and many of the specialty sushi rolls are torched in front of the bar-sitters - a cool sight to see, so grab a bar seat when you're there!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's one of my favorite rolls that I have ever had: The Tomi Special.
      </p>
      <img src="http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uboNB7gFUoH-UnJhdVuQLg/l.jpg" class="blog-image blog-image-center">
      <p>
        You have the option to top this roll with salmon or hamachi (yellowtail). I really love this roll and the concept behind its build because on one hand, it gives eaters a zing with its torched flavor and a unique spicy mayo sauce. On the other, it still respects the fish by giving fairly large slices and leaving the sauce to the side (as opposed to drenching the sushi in oceans of mayo sauces).
      </p>

      <p>
        Sushi Tomi is an awesome restaurant because it caters to both casual goers and sushi elites. And the Tomi Special is a super-tasty and super-appropriate roll to represent. Check em out!

      <div class="blog-post-title">Even the Pros Struggle</div>
      <div class="blog-post-subtitle">January 19, 2015</div>

        Gordon Ramsay, Master Chef and expert restauranteur, while known across America for his boisterous behavior on TV, you can tell he is extremely passionate about cooking. He has a Youtube series on home cooking that's easy to follow and somehow makes cooking techniques seem a lot less overwhelming (have you seen his scrambled eggs? They are game changing!). He likes to teach, and he also likes to push himself to see just how vast the culinary world is.
        Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llG0NTJ7rcU">video</a> of him trying to make sushi alongside of master chefs.
      </p>
      <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/llG0NTJ7rcU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        Ramsay's sushi ended up looking pretty good, but you can differentiate his from the sushi master's. Not only do you have to make sushi look great and taste great - quick speed and precise timing are imperative. You saw the master finish a perfect dragon roll in around 2 minutes, yet, he doesn't seem like he's rushing. Watching this video is a great example of how the more you practice a skill, the more you realize just how far you need to travel to become great. When you first start, you focus so much on technique and presentation. Then, all of a sudden, time pressures are thrown in and the game changes - dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it's kind of comforting to see a world-class pr0, like Ramsay, realize the skill gap as well. You can see that everybody starts somewhere and what truly separates you from the greats is simply the time you put into practicing. I'm sure Gordon Ramsay could make a Dragon Roll in 2 minutes eventually if he just did it a couple of more times. But then again, if you tried a couple of times, I'm sure you eventually could too.

      <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/de/6b/32/de6b329cf12c6785eefd5d518cc08907.jpg" width="40%" class="blog-image blog-image-right">

        People ask me how I got into sushi. Not only is it an unconventional hobby, but it can be quite an expensive one. A year before I started sushi making, I was taking up boxing - something I thought I never could pick up due to my mild-ish nature. However, from my journey of starting from the basics to training to compete in my first amateur fight, boxing taught me that you seriously can do whatever you want. All you need to do is figure out how to get exposure to the new, strange world you want to dive into. And the new world I wanted to step into was sushi.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the first step for exposure was pretty simple. I started learning from watching youtube videos. I haven't even taken a single sushi-making class! As you practice out the basics, you start to figure out the "formula" behind the art of sushi. After that, you can start recreating your favorite sushi from restaurants you've been to, or using your imagination to create your own. And from there, it's only one thing, practice, practice, practice. There's always something to get better at.
      </p>
      <p>
        So yea, I've never had formal training on anything - I've just been guesstimating... probably just about everything! But the point is, that it's never too late to pick up one of your passions. And it's always the perfect time to experiment a new hobby for yourself. So, if there's something you've always wanted to learn or try, go for it now! You'll find a way to make things work if you truly want it to. Time, budgetting, energy, whatever - most of the time, they're probably just excuses you make up for yourself. It would be a shame if these excuses prevented you from doing something freaking awesome, now wouldn't it? So, don't let it happen, get out of your comfort zone, and just take that first step.
