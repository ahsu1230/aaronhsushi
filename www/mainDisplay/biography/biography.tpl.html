        Born and raised in Maryland, Aaron first started eating sushi at the young age of 10, but it wasn't until he discovered the unique heat from wasabi did he become really into it! His journey in sushi first started when he starting watching youtube videos on basic sushi tutorials. From there, Aaron uses his experiences from various sushi joints to create his own tastes, and styles.

        On his free time, Aaron is always thinking about sushi. Whether it is honing his own skills, discovering new recipes, or even just browsing sushi joints online, he loves sushi maybe as much as Gordon Ramsay loves yelling on TV.
