        Okay, fine. I admit. This is some shameless marketing. But, you might actually find it useful!
      </p>

        This link: <a href="https://www.kifi.com/a.aron/how-to-sushi">https://www.kifi.com/a.aron/how-to-sushi</a> is simply a collection of my favorite links, videos and tutorials on how to make sushi. Content ranges from the simplest introductions of how to roll basic rolls to fancy-ass specialty sushi. Start off learning about what you need to start making sushi or get some inspiration on how to make more interesting rolls you won't find in restaurants. There are even some tricks and techniques that you could apply anytime in the kitchen. Some of which include knife sharpening with a wet sone, frying foods, and even vegetable decor.

        Gordon Ramsay, Master Chef and expert restauranteur, while known across America for his boisterous behavior on TV, you can tell he is extremely passionate about cooking. He has a Youtube series on home cooking that's easy to follow and somehow makes cooking techniques seem a lot less overwhelming (have you seen his scrambled eggs? They are game changing!). He likes to teach, and he also likes to push himself to see just how vast the culinary world is.
        Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llG0NTJ7rcU">video</a> of him trying to make sushi alongside of master chefs.

        Ramsay's sushi ended up looking pretty good, but you can differentiate his from the sushi master's. Not only do you have to make sushi look great and taste great - quick speed and precise timing are imperative. You saw the master finish a perfect dragon roll in around 2 minutes, yet, he doesn't seem like he's rushing. Watching this video is a great example of how the more you practice a skill, the more you realize just how far you need to travel to become great. When you first start, you focus so much on technique and presentation. Then, all of a sudden, time pressures are thrown in and the game changes - dramatically.
      </p>

        However, it's kind of comforting to see a world-class pr0, like Ramsay, realize the skill gap as well. You can see that everybody starts somewhere and what truly separates you from the greats is simply the time you put into practicing. I'm sure Gordon Ramsay could make a Dragon Roll in 2 minutes eventually if he just did it a couple of more times. But then again, if you tried a couple of times, I'm sure you eventually could too.

        People ask me how I got into sushi. Not only is it an unconventional hobby, but it can be quite an expensive one. A year before I started sushi making, I was taking up boxing - something I thought I never could pick up due to my mild-ish nature. However, from my journey of starting from the basics to training to compete in my first amateur fight, boxing taught me that you seriously can do whatever you want. All you need to do is figure out how to get exposure to the new, strange world you want to dive into. And the new world I wanted to step into was sushi.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the first step for exposure was pretty simple. I started learning from watching youtube videos. I haven't even taken a single sushi-making class! As you practice out the basics, you start to figure out the "formula" behind the art of sushi. After that, you can start recreating your favorite sushi from restaurants you've been to, or using your imagination to create your own. And from there, it's only one thing, practice, practice, practice. There's always something to get better at.
      </p>
      <p>
        So yea, I've never had formal training on anything - I've just been guesstimating... probably just about everything! But the point is, that it's never too late to pick up one of your passions. And it's always the perfect time to experiment a new hobby for yourself. So, if there's something you've always wanted to learn or try, go for it now! You'll find a way to make things work if you truly want it to. Time, budgetting, energy, whatever - most of the time, they're probably just excuses you make up for yourself. It would be a shame if these excuses prevented you from doing something freaking awesome, now wouldn't it? So, don't let it happen, get out of your comfort zone, and just take that first step.

        This is a great motivational example. This is a website that shows fast-forwarded videos of people who start off a new hobby and spend 100 days practicing it. <a href="https://giveit100.com/">Check it out!</a>
