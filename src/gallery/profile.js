                Sushi has always been a source of happiness for me. My fondest
                childhood memories were celebrating family occasions by ordering
                ridiculous amounts of specialty sushi rolls from our local sushi
                restaurant, Yuraku, in Germantown, Maryland. Eventually, this
                led me wanting to try making the same Yuraku specialty sushi
                rolls at home, which kicked off my first steps towards a very
                long, adventurous journey.

                After a few years working as a Software Engineer, I moved to New
                York City in 2018 to work at Kosaka (1-star Michelin sushi
                omakase restaurant) to see what it means to be a real sushi
                chef. On the side, I was also working shifts at a family-owned
                restaurant, Daimatsu, in New Jersey, a few sushi caterings and
                even a few tuna-cutting shows at Mitsuwa! I worked in New York
                for 18 months before moving back to my hometown in late 2020.
                Though I am not in the restaurant industry anymore, I gained a
                lifetime of knowledge from my experiences and want to share my
                craft and my passion with friends.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, I perform full Edomae-style sushi omakase dinners from my
                apartment here in Washington D.C. Because I source the same
                high-quality Japanese fish as many high-end restaurants in the
                area, my goal is to give guests an unforgettable and affordable
                experience, especially to people new to the omakase world.
                Through my craft, I hope to share my story and just as I was
                inspired to pursue my passion, I hope to inspire others to
                discover and follow their own.
